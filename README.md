# Script with PsBuilder
Get started with PsBuilder by using a simple script. You can change
it to fit your needs, and you might need it to see how your script
builds.

For example, you copy the code of [ConShell](https://github.com/controllershell/cshell) (under the [BSD 2-clause license](https://github.com/controllershell/cshell/blob/main/LICENSE), it would have been built using this tool.
